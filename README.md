<h1>G-Naira Smart Contract</h1>

<p>
  G-Naira is a decentralized cryptocurrency built on the Ethereum blockchain. This smart contract manages the creation and distribution of G-Naira tokens. 
</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>
  To use G-Naira, you'll need an Ethereum wallet that supports ERC-20 tokens. You can purchase G-Naira on cryptocurrency exchanges that support ERC-20 tokens, such as Uniswap or Sushiswap. 
</p>

<h2>Functionality</h2>

<p>
  The G-Naira smart contract includes the following functionality:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Creation of new G-Naira tokens</li>
  <li>Transfer of G-Naira tokens between wallets</li>
  <li>Burning (destruction) of G-Naira tokens</li>
  <li>Approval of third-party wallets to transfer G-Naira tokens</li>
</ul>

<h2>How it Works</h2>

<p>
  The G-Naira smart contract is written in Solidity and is deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. When a user creates a new G-Naira token, the total supply of tokens is recorded in the contract. Tokens can be transferred between wallets by calling the "transfer" function and passing the recipient's wallet address and the number of tokens to transfer. Tokens can also be burned by calling the "burn" function and passing the number of tokens to destroy.
